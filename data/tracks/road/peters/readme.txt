Notes:
The track has a special profile for most of it:

  |                              |
  |.__________________________.__|

| = wall w/fence
_ = road or side
. = red line or curb (border)

Typical measures are:
 track width = 12m
 border = 1m
 side (optional) = 0 - 10m
On some parts there are run-off areas where the side width
is little bit more (drawn on the left).
In the airport area there are modifications for this scheme.

I had trouble getting any height data, so the height changes
are purely random:
python
import random
random.seed()
for i in range (50):
  random.uniform(-2.0, 2.0)

Only exception is the Bay Shore DR area where there is a visual
bump that can be seen clearly on the videos.

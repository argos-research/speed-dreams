II - Linux installation from sources
------------------------------------

1 - Introduction

There are 2 ways of building and installing Speed Dreams from sources :
- from the official source tarballs,
- from the subversion repository.

Pick only one of the above options. If you have trouble during the installation,
have a look in the FAQ on the above sites. In case you get stuck,
please learn how to report the problem in the FAQ before filing a bug or contact us.

Have fun,

The Speed Dreams Team.


2 - Installation from the official tarballs

  a - get these tarballs : please go to our SF.net download page at

        http://sourceforge.net/projects/speed-dreams/files/2.0.0,

      and you should find :

        speed-dreams-src-base-2.0.0-r4687.tar.xz
        speed-dreams-src-hq-cars-and-tracks-2.0.0-r4687.tar.xz
        speed-dreams-src-more-hq-cars-and-tracks-2.0.0-r4687.tar.xz
        speed-dreams-src-wip-cars-and-tracks-2.0.0-r4687.tar.xz
        speed-dreams-src-unmaintained-2.0.0-r4687.tar.xz
        
        and 
        
        speed-dreams-src-partial-build-patch-2.0.0-r4687.tar.xz

      At this point, you have 2 options :
      1. you want full game contents : you need to download the 4 first source packages
         ("base", "hq-cars-and-tracks", "more-hq-cars-and-tracks", "wip-cars-and-tracks"),
         and even the 5th "unmaintained" one (if you really need it, you know it :-)
      2. you don't need full game contents : you need at least the "base" package,
         along with the "partial-build-patch" one ; you can optionnaly add 1 or more of any
         of the other source packages to you basket, as you like.
      
      Let's say that you downloaded your packages in $HOME/sd
      and that we'll extract them in the "2.0.0-r4687" folder
      (you can do as you like, but we'll use this folder in the explanations below).

  b - extract the tarballs :

      Whatever the chosen option (1 or 2) :
      
      $ cd $HOME/sd
      $ mkdir 2.0.0-r4687
      $ cd 2.0.0-r4687
      $ for file in ../*.xz; do tar xvfa $file; done
      
      If you chose option 2 (selected content), then you also have to :
      $ tar xvfa speed-dreams-src-partial-build-patch-2.0.0-r4687.tar.xz

      You should now see "cmake", "data" and "src" folders (among others).

      Advanced: If you chose option 2, and want to add another source package
                after following the above extraction instructions, always
                extract again at the end the "partial-build-patch" package
                before configuring and building ; you can even add contents
                like this after configuring and building ... of course you'll
                then need to configure and build again.

  c - configure :

    1. create the build dir for CMake

      $ mkdir build
      $ cd build

    2. run CMake :

      - for a Release (optimised) build using default 3rd party libs

        Option 1 (full contents) :
        $ cmake -D OPTION_OFFICIAL_ONLY:BOOL=ON ..

        Option 2 (selected contents) :
        $ cmake .. # Don't care about "missing files / folder" messages, this is expected :-)

      - you may also want to override some default settings :

        for that, you can use the -D option of cmake :

          Example :

            $ cmake -D SD_LOCALDIR:STRING=~/dev/.sd-settings \
                    -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:STRING=/usr/local \
                    -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug ..

        or else you can use ccmake to change the variables interactively :

            $ ccmake ..

             * press (t) for advanced options if needed
             * in order to change a variable :
               * select the associated line using the up/down arrow keys
               * press (enter)
               * edit the value
               * press (enter)
             * press (c) for configure
             * press (g) for generate
             * press (e) to exit


        Usefull CMake variables for Speed Dreams (note that some might be "advanced" ones) :

        - CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING :
            Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel (def: Release)

        - OPTION_OFFICIAL_ONLY:BOOL :
            Build/install only official contents (def: OFF)

        - SD_LOCALDIR:STRING :
            User settings dir for run-time (def: ~/.speed-dreams-2)

        - CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:STRING :
            Path prefixes for additional 3rdParty libraries (def:empty)
            (use /usr/local if you compiled some 3rdParty libs yourself).

        - CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH :
            Install path for Speed Dreams (def: /usr/local)

        - OPTION_3RDPARTY_EXPAT:BOOL :
            Enable building against 3rd party Expat 2 library, rather than bundled txml (def: ON)
            Disable if "Expat 2 dev" is not available for your distro (which is very unlikely).

        - OPTION_3RDPARTY_SOLID:BOOL :
            Enable building against 3rd party Free Solid 2 library, rather than bundled one (def: OFF)
            Note: This is not set by default, because Free Solid 2 dev is not yet available
                  on most Linux distros (only Fedora is working on this right now, AFAIK, 2012, July)
                  Ask the dev team for any hint about building it ...

        - OPTION_OSGGRAPH:BOOL :
            Enable building of the WIP new OpenSceneGraph-based graphics module 'osggraph' (def: OFF)
            Note: This requires new 3rd party libs : OpenSceneGraph
            Hint: Once built, to load it at race-time, substitute 'ssggraph' by 'osggraph'
                  in <user settings>/config/raceengine.xml

        - OPTION_TRACE:BOOL :
            Full run-time traces if ON (def: ON)

        - OPTION_TRACE_LEVEL:STRING :
            Run-time traces level integer threshold, only if OPTION_TRACE
            (traces with higher level are not logged ;
             0=Fatal, 1=Error, 2=Warning, 3=Info, 4=Trace, 5=Debug, ...) (def: 5)

        - OPTION_UNLOAD_SSGGRAPH:BOOL :
            The 'ssggraph' graphics engine module will never be unloaded if OFF (def: ON)
            Usefull under some Linux configurations where this unloading badly crashes XOrg
            (see http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/speed-dreams/ticket/209),
            or simply makes SD crash because PLib is shipped as a set of shared libraries
            (see http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/speed-dreams/ticket/459).
 
        - OPTION_FORCE_DEBUG:BOOL :
            Enable debug symbols even in Release builds (def: OFF)

        Tips reported about some issues :
        - sometimes, ENET_INCLUDE_DIR is not detected correctly, resulting in something like
          /usr/include/enet or so, and, consequently, in bad compilation errors because
          /usr/include/enet contains a special time.h header file that conflicts with the standard
          one in /usr/include. Removing the "enet" postfix from ENET_INCLUDE_DIR should fix this
          (in cmake command line or interactively through ccmake).

  d - build:

      $ make
  
  e - install:

      $ sudo make install
  
      Notes:
      * sudo is only useful if your install PREFIX is a read-only folder (like default /usr/local)
      * sudo configuration : you may ask your system administrator to enable you to run
        'sudo make install' ; if he doesn't know how, you can tell him/her
        to add a line like this in /etc/sudoers (or something less permissive ;-) :
           <your login name>    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

3 - Installation from SVN

  Before you start, be aware that the SVN trunk / branches might crash or even not compile
  sometimes. If you want to get it anyway, follow the instructions at
    http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=239111

  For the moment, 
  - the developments for the next release are located in the trunk ; 
    you can checkout the current _development_ state through :
     $ svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/speed-dreams/code/trunk sd-trunk
  - we make branches under the "branches" root dir ; as an exemple,
    you can get the "1.4.x" release maintenance branch current state through :
     $ svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/speed-dreams/code/branches/1.4.x sd-1.4.x
  - we make release tags under the "tags" root dir ; 
    as an exemple, you can get the "2.0.0 RC 1" pre-release through :
     $ svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/speed-dreams/code/tags/2.0.0-rc1 sd-2.0.0-rc1

  See configure, build and install method above (2)
  (note however that branches/1.4.x and tags/1.4.0 are not built through cmake :
   please refer to the dedicated INSTALL file for these).

4 - Run Speed-Dreams

  If the default CMake settings were kept, Speed Dreams is normally installed in /usr/local.

  So, if /usr/local/games is already in your PATH variable, simply try :

    $ speed-dreams-2
      
  If /usr/local/games is not already in your PATH variable, you probably want to add it ;
  to do so, simply add the line "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/games" to your  ~/.bashrc file ;
  you can use :

    $ echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/games" >> ~/.bashrc" for that

  Then, the above startup command should work now :

    $ speed-dreams-2

  If not or if the game crashes, see right below "5 - Known run-time issues".
      
  Runtime options : type this command to get them explained :

    $ speed-dreams-2 --help

  Note: Running the next-generation graphics module "osggraph" :
        There's currently no GUI for selecting the graphics engine ;
        you have to manually change the "graphic" attribute of the "Modules" section
        in <user settings>/config/raceengine.xml, and give it the "osggraph" value.

5 - Known run-time issues :

  * Under some Linux configurations, the game crashes after restarting a race,
    of when exiting ; we have a build-time workaround for this :
    see above, in II-2-c-2, the OPTION_UNLOAD_SSGGRAPH CMake option.

  * If you get all white rectangles or ugly fonts in the menus,
    it's likely that some game data was not properly installed ;
    check again carefully the build and install instructions.

6 - Getting Help

  From inside the game, press F1 at any time, you'll get a help page explaining
  the available keyboard shorcuts.

  If you are stuck please report problems through speed-dreams-users mailing list
  or our bug tracker at http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/speed-dreams/report.


III - Windows installation from sources
---------------------------------------

Note that these instructions work under Windows XP 32 SP2/SP3 ; 
some tweaks might be needed for newer / wider versions.

0) Initial steps, common to all build methods

  a.  Install CMake v2.6+ http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

  b.  Download the official Speed Dreams tarballs from SF.net
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/speed-dreams/files/2.0.0
      (speed-dreams-src-<package>-<version>.tar.xz)
      
        Note: See II.2.a above about which packages you really need.

      or 

      Get the latest trunk from SVN (needed for building with MinGW : was not supported by 2.0.0).

      TODO: Add instructions explaining how to do so, including the minimal list
            of files and sub-dirs needed (not all trunk is needed, from far).

  c.  Extract their contents to your local disk all in the same target folder
      (7Zip is an excellent tool for that http://www.7-zip.org/).
      
        Note: See II.2.b above about the order in which you need to extract the packages.

1) CMake and MinGW :

  Notes: 
   * Tested with success with CMake 2.8.2 and 2.8.8 + MinGW 2012 April (gcc 4.7.0),
   * Also worked well with the version of MinGW shipped with Nokia Qt Creator 2.4.1 (gcc 4.4.0)
     (but needs a dedicated 3rd party binary package which has not been published).
   * Be aware that there are 2 different ways of building with CMake and MinGW :
     - through "MSYS Makefiles" CMake generator : you'll then run all the build commands
       (cmake and make) from the MSYS shell, (sort of a minimal "Linux + bash" environment)
     - through "MinGW Makefiles" CMake generator : it is not compatible with the MSYS way,
       but it works from inside the QtCreator IDE.

  a.b.c. See above 0) Initial steps, common to all build methods

  d.  Install MinGW (and optionaly MSYS)

     Here's a simpler version of the instructions of http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started
     (example here for the official release of 2012, April, featuring gcc 4.7.0) :

     * Download and run the latest mingw-get-inst version from 
        https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst/
        => mingw-get-inst-20120426.exe
     * Select the directory where to install MinGW, remembering the advice
       that the path to this directory should not contain any spaces.
       => C:\MinGW
     * Select the "Download latest repository catalogues" option
       in order to get the latest Gcc (4.7.0 as of now)
       (if you choose "Use pre-packaged catalogues", you'll get an old Gcc 4.6.2,
        which is _not_ compatible with the below mentioned 3rd party binary package.
     * Select the minimal set of components to install :
       * C compiler (always)
       * C++ compiler (always)
       * MSYS (if you don't plan to use QtCreator).

     If you installed MSYS, then you might be interested in the following,
     otherwise, skip it and go to e.

     * Run MSYS, the MinGW Shell (bash) :
       Start Menu / Programs / MinGW / MinGW Shell

       Note: PATH is already configured for using all useful tools
             (try the command "echo $PATH")

     * Optional but usefull additional components :
       * rxvt (a Linux-like terminal) : mingw-get install msys-rxvt
         - customize rxvt terminal : in C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0\msys.bat, line 98 : "start %WD%rxvt ...",
           . -geometry 120x40
           . -sl 9999
         - change MSYS Shell shortcut command : msys.bat --rxvt
       * vim (text elditor for Linux geeks) : mingw-get install msys-vim
       * patch : mingw-get install msys-patch
       * xargs and co : mingw-get install msys-findutils
       * bzip2 : mingw-get install msys-bzip2
       * xz : mingw-get install msys-xz
       * diff and co : mingw-get install msys-diffutils

     * Optional tweaks to /etc/profile (C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc\profile)
       * add your usual aliases : alias xx='command'
       * a simpler prompt : export PS1='\w $ '

     * Direct X 7 SDK for MinGW : Optional for building SD, but mandatory if you want
       to build yourself the 3rd party libraries SDL, PLib, and OpenAL :
       * download it from http://alleg.sourceforge.net/files/dx70_min.zip
       * extract it somewhere on your hard disk (let's say C:\dx7_mingw)
       * add the following line to /etc/fstab (C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc\fstab)
         C:\dx7_mingw /dxsdk # DX7 SDK for compiling SDL, PLib, OpenAL

       Note: The other newer versions from http://alleg.sourceforge.net/files didn't work for me.

  e.  If you didn't install MSYS, you need to install QtCreator
  
      * Download and install the latest version :
        - the simplest way is to get the standalone version from
           http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/downloads#qt-creator
        - you can also get the much heavier full Qt SDK, from
           http://qt.nokia.com/downloads (on-line or off-line installed, as you will)
          which bundles QtCreator itself ... along with the Qt libraries and other dev. tools ... 
          which are not needed for building SD.
          Note: It also ships a working MinGW, but probably not the version that we used
                for building the "3rdParty" binary package for SD (MinGW 4.7.0) ;
                so if you plan to use this version, be ready to build yourself (from sources)
                your own "3rdParty" binary package for SD
                (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/speed-dreams/files/3rd%20party/Sources/post-2.0.0/).

      * Configure it for using your MinGW installation (if not using the auto-detected one bundled with Qt SDK) :
        - start it,
        - Tools / Options opens the Options windows,
        - Select "Compile & Run" in the list of the left,
        - Select the "Compile chain" tab,
        - Click on the "Add / MinGW" button on the top right corner,
        - fill in the fields at the bottom :
          . Path to compiler : Browse and select the MinGW c++ compiler executable 
              (C:\MinGW\bin\mingw32-c++.exe if you installed MinGW 4.7 as explained above)
          . Debugger : Browse and select the MinGW debugger executable 
              (C:\MinGW\bin\gdb.exe if you installed MinGW 4.7 as explained above)
          . ABI, mkspec : leave as is,
        - Apply (at the bottom right corner),
        - Select the "CMake" tab,
        - Browse and select your CMake executable (ex: C:\Program Files\CMake 2.8\bin\cmake.exe),
        - OK (at the bottom right corner).
      
  f.  Download the "MinGW 4.7.0" release of the Speed Dreams "3rdParty" binary package from SF.net
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/speed-dreams/files/3rd%20party/MinGW%204.7.0/
      (it contains necessary 3rd party libs compiled with/for MinGW 4.7.0)
      Note: If you plan to also build and run the new OpenSceneGraph-base graphics module (osggraph),
            you should also download the "OSG extension" of this 3rdparty package (same location).

  g.  Install it in the right folder :

      * If you are using MSYS, extract it to the /usr folder from the MSYS shell :

         $ cd /usr
         $ tar xvfz .../3rdParty-2.1-win32-mingw470-g-O2.tar.gz
         # And if you plan to build osggraph (see above) :
         $ tar xvfz .../3rdParty-2.1-osg-win32-mingw470-O2.tar.gz

         Note: this will populate the MSYS /usr/local tree, just as under Linux :-)

      Or

      * If you are using QtCreator, extract it into the "3rdParty" folder,
        in the same folder as the one which contains your SD source tree :
        - let's say (as an example) that your SD trunk source tree is inside the "sd" folder :
          (so in this folder, you have the "trunk" folder, containing "src", "data", "credits.xml" and so on),
        - open 3rdParty-2.1-win32-mingw470-g-O2.tar.gz in your favorite archive manager
          (7zip is an excellent tool for this : http://www.7-zip.org/),
        - extract the whole "local" folder into the "sd" folder,
        - (same for 3rdParty-2.1-osg-win32-mingw470-O2.tar.gz if needed)
        - rename it to "3rdParty".


  h.  Run CMake to configure the build (here we assume CMake 2.8, but newer versions should work) :

      * If you are using MSYS, in the MSYS shell :

        $ cd /path/to/sd/sources/trunk
        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ /c/Program\ Files/CMake\ 2.8/bin/cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DOPTION_OFFICIAL_ONLY:BOOL=On -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:STRING=/usr/local -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ..

        Note: The 'Release' build gives you -O3-optimised binaries.

        Note: See II.2.c above for more about possible / useful CMake arguments.

      Or

      * If you are using QtCreator (solution 1) :

        - Start QtCreator,
        - File / Open a file or project ...
        - Browse and select the master CMakeLists.txt of Speed Dreams
          (at the top of the source tree, next to the src and data folders)

        - Then the CMake wizard opens up : 
          . Build location page :
             + Browse and select a build folder (CMake will create and use it for building)
                (ex: <path to CMakeLists.txt/../build)
          . Next
          . Run CMake page :  use :

             + CMake arguments : 
                 -DOPTION_OFFICIAL_ONLY:BOOL=On -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release
             + Click on the Run CMake button

             Note: See II.2.c above for more about possible / useful CMake arguments.

             Note: The 'Release' build gives you -O3-optimised binaries.

             Apart from "won't build" or "won't install" message (don't care),
             all should go smoothly, especially the detection of the 3rd party libraries.

          . Done

        - Then QtCreator opens your brand new project !

        Note: 
          . Later on, when starting again QtCreator, the project will be automatically
            loaded in the default session.
          . If you need to re-run CMake (sometimes, QtCreator can't detect it, like after adding
            new / removing files in the source tree, or if you need to change the configuration
            settings), simply use the menu : Compile / Run CMake.

      Or

      * If you are using QtCreator (solution 2) :

        You can also use standard CMake GUI to do this before opening the master CMakeLists.txt in QtCreator,
        but you have to first add C:\MinGW\bin to your PATH environment variable
        otherwise CMake GUI won't propose you the "MinGW generator", which is the one you have to use
        ("MSYS makefiles" does not work with QtCreator).

        - See below 2)f.g.h for how to use CMake GUI, but BEWARE, you have to select
          the "MinGW generator" as the "compiler" (mandatory choice).

          Note: The 'Release' build gives you -O3-optimised binaries.

          Note: Apart from "won't build" or "won't install" message (don't care),
          all should go smoothly, especially the detection of the 3rd party libraries.
      
        - Start QtCreator,
        - File / Open a file or project ...
        - Browse and select the master CMakeLists.txt of Speed Dreams
          (at the top of the source tree, next to the src and data folders)

        - Then the CMake wizard opens up : 
          . Build location page :
             + Browse and select the build folder you chose when running CMake GUI
          . Next
          . Run CMake page : you normally don't need to change anything,
            as QtCreator read it from the CMake generated CMakeCache.txt file :
             + CMake generator : "MinGW generator" (mandatory choice here !)
             + CMake arguments : <leave empty>
             + Click on the Run CMake button
               (Yes, CMake already ran, but needed again because ... hmmm ...
                TODO : discover and then explain why :-)

             Apart from "won't build" or "won't install" message (don't care),
             all should go smoothly, especially the detection of the 3rd party libraries.

          . Done

        - Then QtCreator opens the project !

        Note: 
          . Later on, when starting again QtCreator, the project will be automatically
            loaded in the default session (or any session you saved it in).
          . If you need to re-run CMake (sometimes, QtCreator can't detect it, like after adding
            new / removing files in the source tree, or if you need to change the configuration
            settings), simply use the menu : Compile / Run CMake.

  i.  Configure the build and deployment steps of your project

      * click on the "Projects" button on the left vertical bar
        in order to get the projects configuration panel

      * select your project's tab on the top

      * in the "Compile settings" sub-tab :
        - stay with the default" "all" compile configuration (we need only this)
        - don't change "CMake" section (note that you can re-run CMake from here,
           you'd get into the wizard we used at the beginning)
        - in the "Compilation steps" section, click on the "Details" button of the 1st step,
          and add some arguments to the default "mingw32-make.exe" command :
           . at least the "all" target, at the end of the argument line,
           . and may be some "-j2" of "-j4" boosting option if you own a dual/quad-core CPU :-)
        - leave the other sections as is, they are OK.

      * in the "Run settings" sub-tab :
        - in the "Deployment" section,
          . (cosmetic) change the name of the "Method" : "No deployment" => "Install"
          . click on the "Add the deployment step" button, and select "Make",
          . add the "install" argument to the default "mingw32-make.exe" command.       

  j.  Build

      * If you are using MSYS, in the MSYS shell :

        $ make # use -j2 or even -j4 if you own a dual/quad-core CPU

      * If you are using QtCreator :

        - "Build / Compile all" through the menu (or Shift-Ctrl-B)
      
  k.  Install

      * If you are using MSYS, in the MSYS shell :

        $ make install

      * If you are using QtCreator :

        you have to "Run" Speed Dreams (no separate Install function :-(,
        it'll install le software before running it (see i. above)
      
  l.  Run (and debug) Speed Dreams

      * Of course you can simply double click on the installed speed-dreams-2.exe executable
        (should be in /speed-dreams-2-build/bin with default CMake settings) ...

      * But you can run it from QtCreator : usefull for debugging it :-)

      * For this, you need one last configuration step in QtCreator :

        - click on the "Projects" button on the left vertical bar
          in order to get the projects configuration panel

        - select your project's tab on the top

        - in the "Run settings" sub-tab :
          . in the "Run" section, add a custom configuration
            (we can't run the generated speed-dreams-2.exe in place, 
             we must use the "installed" one) :
            click on the "Add" button, and select "Custom executable",
          . Executable : Browse and select it 
              (should be in /speed-dreams-2-build/bin with default CMake settings)
          . Check the "Run in a terminal" option, to get the run-time traces in a console.

       * You can now "Compile / Run" or "Debug / Start debugging / Start debugging" from the menu !

2) Cmake and MS VC++ 2005 (8) / 2008 (9) / 2010 (10) on Windows XP 32

Note: If you use an "Express" version, don't forget to install also the Windows SDK.

  a.b.c. See above 0) Initial steps, common to all build methods

  d.  Download the "MSVC 2005 / 2.0.0-or-earlier" release of the "3rdParty" binary package from SF.net
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/speed-dreams/files/3rd%20party
      (it contains necessary 3rd party libs compiled with/for MSVC 2005)
  e.  Extract from the zip file the "3rdParty" directory to where speed-dreams sources
      are installed.  
      Example: If sources are in c:\gamesources\speed-dreams\src-2.0.0
               (inside which you should find at least the "src" and "data" folders), 
               then extract 3rd party zip in c:\gamesources\speed-dreams\3rdParty
               (inside which you should find at least the "include" and "lib" folders), 
  f.  Startup CMake GUI and set :
      * "Where is the source code" to c:\gamesources\speed-dreams\src-2.0.0
      * "Where to build the binaries" to c:\gamesources\speed-dreams\src-2.0.0\build
        (if you follow the folder specs above).
  g.  Press "Configure" button, answer "Yes, create the ...\build folder",
      select the right MSVC compiler version and don't change the "Use native compilers" option.
      Press the "Configure" button again, until the "Generate" button is no more greyed.
  h.  Press the "Generate" button.  CMake will generate the solution file "speed-dreams-2.sln"
      and associated project files (*.vcproj) in the ...\build folder
      (Note : .sln/.vcproj are OK for MSVC 2005, but you might get other files extensions
              the later MSVC versions).
  i.  Load speed-dreams-2.sln in MSVC IDE.
  j.  Select the build configuration (Debug, Release, ...).
  k.  Build the whole Solution (Build / Build Solution)
  l.  Build the 'INSTALL' project (right click on it and select Build).
  m.  Double-click on speed-dreams-2.exe in c:\speed-dreams-2-build\bin

 Note: First-ever startups sometimes fail to correctly write the necessary stuff
       into <My documents>\speed-dreams-2.settings and this prevents the game from starting.
       If this happens, simply remove the <My documents>\speed-dreams-2.settings folder
       with Windows explorer, and restart the game : it should now work.

 Note: This should also work with MSVC 2008/2010.
       For MSVC 2003, you'll probably need to rebuild
       a dedicated 3rdParty package for this compiler

 Note : If you need to recompile the 3rdParty package from sources,
        (the "Sources/2.0.0-or-earlier" release of the "3rdParty" package on SF.net Download page)
        be carefull then to rebuild :
         - everything possible
         - for the same configuration (don't mix Release and Debug) 
         - everything for multithreaded DLL integration (/MD & /MDd),
        ... or be ready for headaches, and no support at all ;-)

 Note: Building from SVN repo at SF.net :
       From trunk@r4790, there's CMake support for a new MSVC 2005 3rd party binary package,
       with updated releases of the dependencies, + 2 new ones : Expat 2 and FreeSOLID 2,
       coming there in order to replace the bundled versions (txml and simuv2.1/SOLID-2.0),
       in order SD becomes compatible with FOSS Linux distros (like Fedora, Debian, ...).
       See http://sourceforge.net/projects/speed-dreams/files/3rd%20party/MSVC%202005/post-2.0.0
       (and http://sourceforge.net/projects/speed-dreams/files/3rd%20party/Sources/post-2.0.0),
       along with "II - Linux installation from sources" for some more tips about CMake options.
      
 Note: If you plan to build "osggraph", extract the Open Scene Graph 3.x binaries
       from Alpha Pixel in your 3rdParty folder ; get the ones for your own version of MSVC :
         http://www.alphapixel.com/osg/downloads/free-openscenegraph-binary-downloads
       And after building and installing SD, don't forget to manually copy libpng13.dll
       from the Open Scene Graph package to SD "bin" install folder
       (because Alpha Pixel's OSG libs are dynamically linked to libpng, which is neither the case
        for the remainder of our 3rd party MSVC 2005 package, nor for SD itself).

3) MS VC++ 6 : No more supported.
